                <p>Inside this box is my love, my heart, and all the warmth I have for you. My Dearest Love, Happy, happy birthday, my angel! Today is not just any day‚Äîit‚Äôs the day the world was blessed with your existence, and I cannot begin to express
                    how grateful I am for you. If only you knew how much space you take up in my heart, how every beat of it whispers your name, how every thought of mine is wrapped in the warmth of your love. Being away from you today is the hardest
                    thing, because all I want is to hold you, to look into your beautiful eyes, and to tell you over and over again just how much you mean to me. But distance cannot dim the fire of my love for you‚Äîit only makes me long for you more, cherish
                    you deeper, and dream of the day when there will be no miles between us, only our hearts beating together in the same place. I want you to know, with every part of me, that you are my forever. I don‚Äôt just love you; I adore you. I
                    breathe for you. I dream of a life with you‚Äîone where I wake up every morning beside you, where your laughter fills our home, where we build a future side by side, hand in hand, heart in heart. I want to be your husband so bad, to
                    be the one who protects you, loves you endlessly, and makes you the happiest woman alive. Today, my love, I wish you nothing but happiness. You deserve a day as beautiful as your soul, as bright as your smile, and as warm as your love.
                    I pray that every dream of yours comes true, that joy surrounds you always, and that you never, ever doubt how cherished you are‚Äîespecially by me. So, my love, close your eyes, make a wish, and know that somewhere out there, there
                    is a heart that beats only for you, a soul that is forever yours, and a man who cannot wait to call you his wife one day. Happy birthday, my love, my future, my everything. this song just express how i feel when i see ur eyes
                    <3 Forever
                        yours, Rahimouch kharyouch ‚ù§Ô∏è</p>
