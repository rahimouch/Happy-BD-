                <p>Inside this box is my love, my heart, and all the warmth I have for you. My Dearest Rahma,

From the depths of my heart, I send you this letter on your most special day‚Äîyour birthday. Today, the universe celebrates the birth of the most beautiful soul to ever exist, and I celebrate the day fate brought you into my life.

Rahma, you are more than just the love of my life‚Äîyou are my dream, my forever, my greatest blessing. Every day, I wake up with you in my heart, and every night, I close my eyes with thoughts of you filling my mind. No words can fully capture the depth of my love for you, but if I could, I would carve them into the stars just so you‚Äôd always see them shining down on you.

I wish I could be by your side right now, holding you close, whispering how much I love you, and making this day as special as you are. But even across the miles, my heart belongs to you, and my love knows no distance.

On this beautiful day, I wish for all your dreams to come true, for happiness to follow you wherever you go, and for our love to grow even stronger. One day, my love, I will be there‚Äînot just for your birthday, but for every sunrise and every sunset, as your husband, your protector, and the man who will love you for all eternity.

Happy birthday, my love. You are my everything.
